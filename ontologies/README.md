Programming Ontology
====================
The ontology organizes the concepts that represent the domain topics using a taxonomy. It provides a general indexing scheme that includes similarity knowledge between the concepts representing these topics. As we will show, this similarity knowledge will be exploited by the recommendation strategy. The ontology also links each LO with the concepts that it covers. This information will be used by the recommendation strategy in order to determine the suitability of each LO.
